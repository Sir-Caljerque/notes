# Why Floats Lose Precision in Binary

A fixed number of bits for representation of floats means that some floats cannot be precisely represented in a computer.
- Fraction that requires more bits than allocated Ex. 0.125 when only one fraction bit is allowed
- Rational number with infinite repeating fraction Ex. 0.666666...
- Irrational number Ex. $\pi$ or $\sqrt{2}$

Increasing precision bits improves precision, but more storage is used.
