Use the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) service to proivision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch your AWS resources

Amazon VPC provides control over your virtual networking resources, such as selecting your own IP address range, creating subnets, and configuring route table and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure access to resources and applications

You can also customize the network configuration for your VPC. For example, you can create a public subnet for your web servers that can access the public internet. You can place your backend systems, such as databases or application servers, in a private subnet without public internet access.

Finally, you can use multiple layers of security in a VPC to help control access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the VPC's subnets. Security mechanisms include security groups and network access control lists (ACLs).
