#Note: Diagram of a three-tier web application that includes a presentation layer, business logic layer, and data storage layer. A VPC has subnets in two Availability Zones. The presentation layer includes two public subnets, one in each Availability Zone. One subnet contains a security group with a host instance, and the other subnet has a NAT gateway. An Application Load Balancer in this layer manages traffic between the internet and a frontend Auto Scaling group in the business logic layer. This Auto Scaling group handles scaling for frontend instances across the two Availability Zones. A Network Load Balancer in the business logic layer layer manages traffic between the frontend Auto Scaling group and a backend Auto Scaling group. The backend Auto Scaling group handles scaling for backend instances across the two Availability Zones. The data storage layer contains a primary database in one Availability Zone, with a read-only database in the second Availability Zone. The data storage layer communicates with the backend Auto Scaling group in the business logic layer.

A three-tier architecture is a software architecture pattern where the application has 3 logical tiers: the presentation layer, the application layer, and the data storage layer. This architecture is used in a client-server application such as a web application that has a frontend, backend, and database. Each layer or tier performs a specific task and can be managed independently of each other. This represents a shift from the monolithic way of building an application where the frontend, backend, and database are all in one place.
