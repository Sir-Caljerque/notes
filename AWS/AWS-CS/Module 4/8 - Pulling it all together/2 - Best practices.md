- Control traffic at all layers
- Inspect and filter your traffic at the application level
- Automate network protection
- Limit exposure

One of the best practices to protect your network is to apply controls for both inbound and outbound traffic. For a VPC, this includes using security groups, network ACLs, and subnets. Use subnets in multiple Availability Zones to separate layers of your application. Configure security groups and network ACLs to only allow the necessary inbound and outbound traffic.

Another best practice is to inspect and filter network traffic at the application level

In addition, use threat intelligence and anomaly detection to automate protection mechanisms to provide a self-defending network

Finally, limit exposure of the workload to the internet and internal networks by only allowing the minimum required access
