When you create a VPC, every instance in that VPC gets a private IP address automatically. You can also request a public IP address to be assigned when you create the instance by modifying the subnetâ€™s auto-assign public IP address properties. A public IP address is used to access the internet.

Public IP addresses are dynamic. If you stop or start your instance, a new public IP is assigned. For production projects, use an Elastic IP address rather than an assigned public IP, which will be dissociated if you stop the instance.
