Some key takeaways from this section of the module include the following:
- Public subnets are used when external traffic needs to reach an interface, such as an EC2 instance.
- Private subnets are often used to host database instances that don't need to be accessed through the public internet.
- Route tables determine where traffic is to be routed in your VPC.
