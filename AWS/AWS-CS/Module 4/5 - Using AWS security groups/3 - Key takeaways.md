Some key takeaways from this section of the module include the following:
- A security group acts as a virtual firewall for an instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- Security groups are stateful, which means that state information is kept even after a request is processed.
- All rules are evaluated before a decision is made to allow traffic.
