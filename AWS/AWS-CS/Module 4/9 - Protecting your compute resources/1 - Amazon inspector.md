Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. The service helps you to identify security vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices in applications, both before they are deployed and while they are running in a production environment. For example, the service can help you check for unintended network accessibility of your EC2 instances and for vulnerabilities on those instances.

Amazon Inspector provides you the opportunity to define standards and best practices for your applications, and validate adherence to these standards. This simplifies enforcement of your organizationâ€™s security standards and best practices, and helps to proactively manage security issues before they impact your production application.

After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed list of security findings, prioritized by level of severity. You can review these findings directly or as part of detailed assessment reports, which are available through the AWS Management Console or API.
