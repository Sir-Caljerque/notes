This can be for interactive tasks and to make programmatic requests to AWS services using the API or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
# IAM identity

- IAM resources are the users, groups, roles, policies, and identity provider objects that are stored in IAM. As with other AWS services, you can add, edit, and remove resources from IAM.
