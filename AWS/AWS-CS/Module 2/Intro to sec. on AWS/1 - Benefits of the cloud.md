## **Trade fixed expense for variable expense:** 
* Instead of needing to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you will use them, pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
## **Benefit from massive economies of scale:** 
* by using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you go prices.
## **Stop guessing on your capacity needs:**
* Stop guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often either sit on expensive idle resources or deal with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes of notice.
## **Increase speed and agility:**
* In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away. This means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, because the cost and time that it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
## **Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers:**
* Focus on projects that differentiate your business instead of focusing on the infrastructure. With cloud computing, you can focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.
## **Go global in minutes:**
* Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
