- How do i ensure high availability?
	The increase in agility and the ability to perform actions faster, at a larger scale and at a lower cost, does not invalidate well - established principles of information security
	AWS designs data centers with excess bandwidth, so that if a major disruption occurs, sufficient capacity is available to load balance traffic and route it to remaining sites, to minimize the impact on our customers
* Can I automatically deploy apps with security and compliance related settings?
	AWS tools are purpose built, and tailored to your unique environment, size, and global requirements. By building security tools from the ground up, AWS can automate many of the routine tasks that security experts normally spend time on. This means AWS security experts can spend more time focusing on measures to increase the security of your AWS Cloud environment. Customers can also automate security engineering and operations functions by using a comprehensive set of APIs and tools.
* How can I apply security checks in a reproducible manner?
	When you automate by using AWS services such as AWS CloudFormation, rather than manually deploying an environment for forensics troubleshooting, for example, you can have AWS deploy an environment in a secure and reproducible manner.
