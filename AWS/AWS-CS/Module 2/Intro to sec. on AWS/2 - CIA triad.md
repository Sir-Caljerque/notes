# **Security**
* is the practice of protecting your intellectual property from unauthorized access, use, or modification. The triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, or CIA, was originally developed to highlight the important aspects of information security within an organization.
	* **Confidentiality** refers to limiting information access and disclosure to authorized users and preventing access by unauthorized people.
		* Limit access and disclosure to authorized users
		* Prevent access by unauthorized people
	* **Integrity** involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire life-cycle. This includes “origin” or “source integrity,” which is assurance that the sender of that information is who it is supposed to be. Integrity can mean ensuring that the person or entity in question entered the correct information. However, integrity of an information system might only mean preserving data without corruption of whatever was transmitted into or entered into the system.
		* Maintain data consistency during its lifecycle
		* Preserve data in transit
	* **Availability** refers to the readiness of information resources. An information system that is not available when you need it is almost as useless as no information system. Modern day IT environments bring challenges to the CIA triad because of the volume of information that must be safeguarded, the multiplicity of sources that the data comes from, and the variety of formats.
		* Have access to information resources when needed.

* *Security tools* - because the cloud doesn't have physical servers/storage, software-based *security tools* monitor and protect the flow of info, as opposed to on-premises security and cameras.
