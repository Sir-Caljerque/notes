# Automate routine security tasks with APIs
You can automate security engineering and operations functions by using a comprehensive set of APIs and tools. You can fully automate identity management, network security and data protection, and monitoring capabilities, and deliver them by using popular software development methods that you already have in place. Rather than having people monitor your security position and react to an event, with automation, your system can monitor, review, and initiate a response
# Implement infrastructure as code
In the AWS Cloud, you can turn your infrastructure into code. With this capability, you can automate the creation of trusted environments to conduct deeper investigations and forensics. You can run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery. By automating deployments and maintenance, you can remove operator access to reduce your attack surface area.
