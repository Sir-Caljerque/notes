# Be ready to scale and absorb the attack
Certain AWS services, such as AWS Auto Scaling and Amazon CloudFront, help applications to scale to absorb common infrastructure layer attacks such as UDP reflection attacks and SYN floods. A UDP reflection attack takes place when the attacker asks the target computer for information by using a forged source address. A SYN flood is a type of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that aims to make a server unavailable to legitimate traffic by consuming all available server resources. By using techniques such as automatic scaling, you can absorb larger volumes of application layer attacks.
# Safeguard exposed resources
Generally, a cyberattack shuts down due to two reasons: either the attackers exhaust themselves and give up, or the attackers achieve their goal. Reduce your exposure to unintended access by hardening operating systems and minimizing the components, libraries, and externally consumable services in use. Start by reducing unused components, such as operating system packages and applications. Configure security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to help reduce the attack surface of your applications.
