# Use a defense in depth approach
Rather than only focusing on the protection of a single outer layer, apply a defense in depth approach with other security controls. This means to apply security to all layers, such as your network, application, and data store. For example, you can require users to strongly authenticate to an application. In addition, ensure that users come from a trusted network path and require access to the decryption keys to process encrypted data. One of the benefits of using AWS is that our services are also built for integration. You can use several AWS services together to provide the most secure environment for your data and resources
# Use different AWS services
AWS customers are able to tailor, or harden, the configuration of an EC2 instance, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) container, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance, and persist this configuration to an immutable Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Then, all new virtual servers (instances) launched with this AMI receive the hardened configuration, whether they are launched manually or through automatic scaling.
