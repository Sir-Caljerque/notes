# Use encryption and access controls
Safeguarding data is a critical piece of building and operating information systems. AWS provides services and features that help you to protect your data at rest and in transit. Safeguards include fine - grained access controls to objects, creating and controlling the encryption keys that are used to encrypt your data, selecting appropriate encryption methods, integrity validation, and appropriate data retention. To help you manage protection, implement a tagging schema to classify your data into sensitivity levels
# Classify your data with logs and tags

# Use VPN and TLS connections
Another security best practice is to construct mechanisms to protect data in transit, such as using virtual private network (VPN) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections.
AWS provides multiple means to encrypt data at rest and data in transit. We build features into our services that make it easier to encrypt your data. For example, we have implemented server - side encryption (SSE) for Amazon S3 to make it easier for you to store your data in an encrypted form. You can also arrange for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to handle the entire HTTPS encryption and decryption process (generally known as SSL termination).
