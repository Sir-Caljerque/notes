In the MSO model, workload owners handle the actual deployment, development, and maintenance of applications. Workload owners typically include system administrators, developers, and others who are directly responsible for one or more applications. Adding an MSO helps ensure that applications are deployed in a secure and compliant fashion through the automated implementation of organizational security requirements. Having an MSO also means that the workload owner can scope down their authorization documentation to only the configuration and installation of software that is specific to a particular application. This is because the workload owner inherits a significant portion of the security control implementation from the MSO

AWS customer MSOs often perform the following activities:
- Account provisioning: After reviewing the workload owner’s use case, the MSO establishes the initial account, connects it to the appropriate account for consolidated billing, and configures basic security functionality before granting access to the workload owner.
- Security oversight: With centralized account provisioning, the MSO can implement features that enable security personnel to monitor the application as it is deployed and managed. The MSO might perform activities such as establishing an auditor group with cross - account access and linking the application VPC to a shared services VPC that the MSO controls
- Amazon VPC configuration: An Amazon VPC configuration includes the VPC and its subnets, security group configurations, and network access control lists (ACLs). To maintain tighter control over the application VPCs, the MSO might retain control of VPC configuration and require the workload owner to request wanted changes to network security
- IAM configuration: The MSO can create user groups and assign permissions. This can include creating groups for internal auditors, an IAM superuser, and application administrative groups that are segregated by functionality (for example, database and Unix administrators).
- Development and approval of templates: The MSO can create preapproved CloudFormation templates for common use cases. By using templates, workload owners inherit the security implementation of the approved template, which limits their authorization documentation to the features that are unique to their application. Templates can be reused to shorten the time required to approve and deploy new applications.
- AMI creation and management: The MSO can create a library of common, approved AMIs for the organization, thus providing centralized management and updating of machine images. By creating common templates, the MSO can enforce the use of approved AMIs.
- Development of a shared services VPC: With a shared service VPC, the MSO can receive nearly continuous monitoring feeds from the organization’s application VPC and common, shared services that are required for their organization. This often includes a shared access management platform, logging endpoints, and aggregation of configuration information
