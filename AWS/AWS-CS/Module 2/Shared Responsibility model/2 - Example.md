Consider an example where your company uses Amazon S3 to store data. Your AWS environment also includes EC2 instances and an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance. These resources run a MySQL database, which is deployed inside a virtual private cloud (VPC). One EC2 instance hosts a web server, and the web application that runs on it uses the database to store application data.

In this scenario, AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure, which contains the physical servers that host the virtual machines and storage hardware. These virtual machines and storage hardware host your S3 bucket, EC2 instances, and database instance. AWS is responsible for the security of the physical networking infrastructure that ensures that these components can be accessed. AWS is also responsible for the security of the hypervisor layer that hosts the EC2 instances. (The hypervisor is the host OS that runs the EC2 instances, which are virtual machines that run guest operating systems.)

You (the customer) are responsible for managing the guest OS that runs on the EC2 instances (including Microsoft Windows or Linux OS updates and security patches). You are also responsible for managing any application software or utilities that you install. Additionally, you are responsible for the configuration of the security groups that control network access to each EC2 instance and to the RDS database instance. You are also responsible for configuring security on the S3 bucket and the objects that you store in it. For example, you could use one or more of the security features that AWS provides, such as bucket policies, data encryption, and S3 Block Public Access.
