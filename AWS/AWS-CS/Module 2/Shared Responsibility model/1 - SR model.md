Shared responsibility model listing customer and AWS responsibilities. Customer is responsible for security in the cloud. This includes customer data. Platform, applications, identity and access management. Operating system, network, and firewall configuration. Client - side data encryption and data integrity, authentication. Server - side encryption of file system and data. Networking traffic protection, to include encryption, integrity, and identity. AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. This includes the AWS foundation services for compute, storage, databases, and networking. And the AWS Global Infrastructure, to include Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations.

Security and compliance are shared responsibilities between AWS and customers. AWS operates, manages, and controls security of the cloud. This responsibility includes securing components, from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where the service operates. AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.

You assume responsibility and management in the cloud. The security steps that you must take depend on the services that you use and the complexity of your system. Customer responsibilities include selecting and securing operating systems that run on EC2 instances, and securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources. Customers must also select and handle security group configurations, firewall configurations, network configurations, and secure account management. Customers are also responsible for managing their data, including encryption options

To reiterate, AWS secures the hardware, software, facilities, and networks that run all AWS products and services. You are responsible for what you implement by using AWS products and services, and for the applications that you connect to AWS. The security steps that you must take depend on the services that you use and the complexity of your system
