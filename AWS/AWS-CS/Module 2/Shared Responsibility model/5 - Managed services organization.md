One approach to implement security and governance is to create a centralized team that is responsible for establishing repeatable processes and templates to deploy applications to AWS while maintaining organizational control over the deployments. Such a team could be either internal or external (third - party vendors), and is often referred to as a provisioning team, center of excellence, or managed services organization (MSO). External vendors are commonly referred to as managed service providers (MSPs). AWS validates AWS Partners under the AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Program

MSOs or MSPs are typically responsible for provisioning accounts; establishing repeatable processes for deployment; auditing the deployments of workload owners; and hosting shared services for security, continuous monitoring, connectivity, and authentication. MSOs essentially create the guardrails for security, data protection, and disaster recovery in the company
