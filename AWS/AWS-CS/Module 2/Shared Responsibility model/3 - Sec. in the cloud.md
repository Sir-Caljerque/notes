While AWS secures and maintains the cloud infrastructure, you are responsible for securing everything that you put IN the cloud

Before you architect any workload, you need to put practices in place that influence security. You will want to control who can do what. In addition, you want to be able to identify security incidents, protect your systems and services, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. You should have a well - defined and practiced process to respond to security incidents. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations

When using AWS services, you maintain complete control over your content and are responsible for managing critical security requirements, including the following:
- The content you choose to store on AWS
- The AWS services that are used with the content
- The country in which that content is stored
- The format and structure of that content, and whether it is masked, anonymized, or encrypted
- Who has access to that content, and how those access rights are granted, managed, and revoked
