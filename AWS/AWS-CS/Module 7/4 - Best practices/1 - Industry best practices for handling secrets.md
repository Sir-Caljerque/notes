- ID key personnel, external resources, and tooling
- Automate containment capabilities
- Develop incident response plans
- Pre-provision access and tools
- Run incident response game days

To improve incident response, start by **identifying key personnel** in your organization. Maintain a contact list of personnel within your organization who you would need to involve when responding to and recovering from an incident. Engage with **external partners**, if necessary, to help you respond to and recover from an incident. Also,research and test **tools** that would help your organization respond to and recover from an incident. Automated containment of an incident can reduce response times and organizational impact.

Preparation is critical to minimize disruption from an incident. Create easy-to-follow run books that **detail the steps to take to respond to and recover from an incident**. Ensure that your escalation and communications plans include personnel in your organization and external parties that you must notify at each stage during an incident. Have a process to identify and document the root cause of an event so that you can develop mitigation strategies to limit or prevent recurrence,and develop procedures for prompt and effective responses. As part of your planning, ensure that security personnel have the right tools **pre-deployed into AWS**. Also, ensure that security personnel have the correct access **pre-provisioned into AWS** so that they can appropriately respond to an incident.

Rehearse incident response and recovery frequently. **Run simulated incident response events, or game days**, that involve key staff and management for different threats. Use lessons learned from running game days as part of a feedback loop to improve your processes.
