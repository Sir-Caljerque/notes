Incident response has two phases. The first phase is the discovery and recognition phase. Here is where incident identification, logging, and categorization of the incident takes place. Once an incident is identified through user reports, solution analyses, or manual identification, the incident is logged and an investigation and categorization can begin.

During this phase, a notification is received. Notifications are set up by the user and initiated by specified alerts to send an email, SMS text, or push notification through a mobile app. Incident escalationis what happens when an employee canâ€™t resolve an incident themselves and needs to hand off the task to a more experienced or specialized employee.

Investigation and diagnosis includes conducting an incidentinvestigationto gather answers and develop strategies to resolve any threats.
