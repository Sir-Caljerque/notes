How would an enterprise know if abuse was taking place? How would they differentiate between abnormal events that need their attention, and incidents that need immediate analysis and remediation?

**Not all events are incidents in need of immediate remedy.** Letâ€™s take a look at a few examples of such events:
- Logging in from a remote location: An employee might be traveling or using an approved virtual private network (VPN).
- Failing hard drive that is still fully operational: Knowing this information allows an enterprise to timely schedule a cycling of the drives without panicking and hot swapping when it's too late and has already failed. Hot swapping is the act of removing components from or plugging them into a computer system while the power remains switched on.
- Employee trying to access resources that they shouldn't access: Although this might not constitute a breach if the access was denied, it's still a behavioral insight that you should monitor.
