- AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS
- You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want, and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that.
- An enterprise can use CloudFormation to recreate a staging environment inside an isolated, or forensic, virtual private cloud (VPC)
    - Once the system is isolated, the team can deep dive and discover the issue, possibly reproduce the issue, apply a fix, and test. Then, the team can push any new infrastructure, as code, or any new application code to production.
