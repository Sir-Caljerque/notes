- Automatically protects an enterprise network from a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack
    - AWS Shield helps protect an enterprise network against a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam clogging up the highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.
- Offers the AWS Shiled Advanced managed threat protection service to improve your security posture with additional DDoS detection, mitigation, and response capabilities
    - When you build your application on AWS, you receive automatic protection against common DDoS attacks. Additionally, you can use the AWS Shield Advanced managed threat protection service to improve your security posture with additional DDoS detection, mitigation, and response capabilities.
