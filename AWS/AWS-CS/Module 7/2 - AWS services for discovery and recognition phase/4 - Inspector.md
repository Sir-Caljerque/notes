- Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans your AWS workloads for vulnerabilities.
- Amazon Inspector automatically discovers and scans Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and container images that reside in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.
- When Amazon Inspector discovers a software vulnerability or network issue, the service creates a finding. A findingdescribes the vulnerability, identifies the affected resource, rates the severity of the vulnerability, and provides remediation guidance.
