The AWS Trusted Advisor service draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment, and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to improve performance and help close security gaps

If you have an AWS Basic Support or Developer Support plan, you can use the AWS Management Console to access core security checks and all checks for service quotas. If you have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you can use the console, AWS Support API, and AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to access all checks, including cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, performance, and service quotas.

You also can use Amazon EventBridge to monitor the status of Trusted Advisor checks.
