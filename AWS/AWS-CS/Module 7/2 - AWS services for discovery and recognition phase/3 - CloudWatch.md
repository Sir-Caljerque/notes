Amazon CloudWatch provides a reliable, scalable, and flexible monitoring solution that you can start using within minutes. By using this service, you don't need to set up, manage, and scale your own monitoring systems and infrastructure.

The CloudWatch console home page automatically displays metrics about every AWS service that you use. You can additionally create custom dashboards to display metrics about your custom applications and display custom collections of metrics that you choose.

You can create alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring when a threshold is breached.

With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.
