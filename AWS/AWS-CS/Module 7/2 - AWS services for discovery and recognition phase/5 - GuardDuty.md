- Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service.
- It can help to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized or malicious activity in your AWS environment.
- The service uses threat intelligence feeds
    - such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity within your AWS environment. This can include issues such as escalations of privileges, use of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IP addresses or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances serving malware or mining bitcoin. The service also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as unauthorized infrastructure deployments (for example, instances being deployed in a Region that has never been used) and unusual API calls (for example, a password policy change to reduce password strength).
