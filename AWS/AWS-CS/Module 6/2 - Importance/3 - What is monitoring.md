Monitoringis the practice of continuously verifying the security and performance of your resources and data. AWS provides several services that you can use to monitor your resources, but this module will focus on two: AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch.

CloudTrail provides a record of actions taken within your environment. CloudTrail logs include information such as the action type, identity of the user, and time and date of the action. With this information, you can monitor who is doing what and when they are doing it.

With CloudWatch, you can monitor your resources and applications in real time. CloudWatch provides you with system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.

Monitoring services and tools, along with a solid incident response plan, can help you mitigate the effects of a system outage or malicious actor. In many cases, monitoring can help you to spot an issue before it has operational impact.
