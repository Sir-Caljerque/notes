A comprehensive logging methodology can help you in every phase of your incident response strategy. Log files are also a primary focus point in incident response. This is because of their ability to provide detailed, time-stamped records to investigators and incident responders. Logging provides a record of events captured at a specific point in time. Common log files include access logs, application logs, system logs, event logs, API call logs, and database logs.

Log files can assist in troubleshooting performance issues within your AWS Cloud and on-premises environment. Logs are also necessary to perform security audits and adhere to recordkeeping requirements to demonstrate compliance with a number of regulatory measures. Examples of regulatory measures include the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Brazil's General Data Protection Law (LGPD). Finally, log files can assist you to remediate issues that arise organically or through audits. Logs provide you with insights on the point in time when an issue arose.
