- Helps to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources
- Continuously monitors and records AWS resource configurations
- Provides automated evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.

With the AWS Config service, you can assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. AWS Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations, which provides you with the ability to automate the evaluation of those configurations against desired configurations. You can also use AWS Config to view IAM policies that are assigned to IAM users, groups, or roles at any time that AWS Config was recording. This capability can aid you in determining what permissions belonged to what user at that specific time. AWS Config can assist you to maintain auditing and compliance by providing historical resource configurations. With the wide range of AWS Config capabilities, you can simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and operational troubleshooting in your AWS environment.

An example of an area where AWS Config is a valuable asset is change management. When your resources are created, updated, or deleted, AWS Config streams these configuration changes to Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), so that you are notified of all the configuration changes. AWS Config represents relationships between resources so that you can assess how a change to one resource may impact other resources.
