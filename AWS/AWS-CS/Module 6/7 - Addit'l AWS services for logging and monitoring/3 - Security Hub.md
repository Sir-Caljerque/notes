AWS Security Hub is a service that assists you to monitor your cloud security posture through the use of automated, continuous security best practice checks against your AWS resources. Security Hub aggregates security alerts from various AWS services and third-party partner products, and presents them in a standardized format, making it easier for you to act on the alerts. You can also use Security Hub to create automated response, remediation, and enrichment workflows by taking advantage of Security Hub's integration with EventBridge. Security Hub provides a security score for each enabled standard and a total score for all accounts associated with your administrator account. This information can assist you to monitor your overall security posture.

One example of how AWS Security Hub can help is by assisting you in prioritizing the response and remediation efforts of your central security teams and DevSecOps teams bysearching, correlating, and aggregating diverse security findings by accounts and resources.
