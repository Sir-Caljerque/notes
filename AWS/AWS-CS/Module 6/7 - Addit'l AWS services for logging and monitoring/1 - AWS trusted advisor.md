AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices, which have been learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks based on five categories of AWS best practices. The checks identify ways to optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas.

Assume you're the administrator of your organization's AWS account. You're looking for ways to optimize your account resources and improve your overall security posture, but the time it would take to do so manually would be prohibitive. AWS Trusted Advisor can automate this process for you, providing you with recommendations for actions you can take to improve these areas. You can then follow the recommendations to optimize your resources and security posture.

Trusted Advisor is available in all AWS Support plans. AWS Basic Support and AWS Developer Support customers can access core security checks and all checks for service quotas.AWS Business Support and AWS Enterprise Support customers can access all checks, including cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, performance, and service quotas.
