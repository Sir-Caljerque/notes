- Define your organizational requirements for logs, alerts, and metrics
- Configure service ans app logging throughout your workload
- Analyze your logs centrally

The first step to use the logging and monitoring capabilities that AWS provides is to define your requirements. Identify the resources, applications, and services that you want to maintain logs for. Logging and monitoring requirements can vary widely, so you must determine what the organizational, legal, and compliance requirements for your workloads are. Then, evaluate and identify the resources that AWS has available to assist.

When you collect metrics and define baselines, you can gain insights to potentialsecuritythreats. Define who should receive alerts and what they should do with the alerts that they receive. Configure logging throughout theworkload, including application logs, AWS services logs, and resource logs.

Collect your logs centrally. Use automation from services such as CloudWatch to analyze logs to detect any anomalies or indicators of malicious activity or compromise.
