AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance and compliance, as well as operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) and APIs. You can view, search, download, archive, analyze, and respond to these recorded events in the CloudTrail console.

You can integrate CloudTrail into applications by using the API, automate trail creation for your organization, check the status of trails you create, and control how users view CloudTrail events
