Server-side encryption is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it.With AWS server-side encryption, your source data comes from systems in your data center or an EC2 instance. You can upload that data over an HTTPS connection to any of the AWS services that support automatic server-side encryption. The service endpoint will handle the encryption and key management processes for you.

With Amazon S3, encryption is an optional step that you specify when you upload your data to the service.
