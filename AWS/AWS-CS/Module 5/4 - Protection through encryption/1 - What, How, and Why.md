Encryption works by using an algorithm with a key to convert plaintext data into unreadable data (ciphertext) that can only become readable again with the right key. For example, a simple phrase such as “Hello World!” might look like “1c28df2b595b4e30b7b07500963dc7c” when encrypted.

Several different encryption algorithms exist, all using different types of keys. A strong encryption algorithm relies on mathematical properties to produce ciphertext that can’t be decrypted by using any practically available amount of computing power without also having the necessary key. Therefore, protecting and managing the keys becomes a critical part of any encryption solution.
