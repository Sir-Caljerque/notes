By making it easy to enable SSL/TLS, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) helps organizations to meet regulatory and compliance requirements for encryption of data in transit. ACM handles the complexity of creating and managing public SSL/TLS certificates for your AWS based websites and applications. You can also use ACM to issue private SSL/TLS X.509 certificates that identify users, computers, applications, services, servers, and other devices internally.


ACM provides a single interface for you to manage both public and private certificates. With ACM, you can easily create and deploy public and private certificates for your on-premises resources, such as internal servers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. You can also deploy private or public certificates on AWS resources, such as load balancers, Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon API Gateway endpoints by using the AWS Management Console or the ACM API.

ACM is also designed to protect and manage private certificates. The service can also help you minimize downtime due to misconfigured or expired certificates. ACM helps manage the challenges of maintaining certificates, including certificate renewals so that you donâ€™t have to worry about outages that result from expiring certificates.Renewed certificates are deployed automatically on AWS resources.
