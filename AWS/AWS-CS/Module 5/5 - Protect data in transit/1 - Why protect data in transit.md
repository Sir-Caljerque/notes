# Your communications might go through the public internet
Data in transit is data that is actively moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or through a private network. To protect data in transit, you protect data while it's traveling from network to network or being transferred from a local storage device to a cloud storage device. Wherever data is moving, protection measures are critical, as data is often considered less secure while in motion.

Cloud applications often communicate over public links, such as the internet, so it's important to protect data in transit when you run applications in the cloud. This involves protecting network traffic between clients and servers, and network traffic between servers.

# What are the risks that data in transit exposed?
While being transferred through various applications and networks, data in transit is exposed to the following 
risks:
- Accidental Information disclosures
- Data integrity compromises
- Identity compromises
    - Man-in-the-middle attacks
    - Identity spoofing

A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a form of cyberattackin which criminals exploit weak web-based protocols to insert themselves between entities in a communication channel to steal data. The attacker is in the middle of ongoing communication between two entities. This type of attack makes the network vulnerable to packet sniffing and modification.
