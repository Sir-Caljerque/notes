ACM Private CA is secured with HSMs. These HSMs adhere to FIPS 140-2 Level 3 security standards to help protect your private CA against key compromises. CA administrators can also control access to the service by using IAM policies. ACM Private CA publishes and updates certificate revocation lists to an S3 bucket automatically to help prevent the use of revoked certificates. For instance, an IoT application can check if the private certificate for a sensor is valid before accepting data from the sensor. ACM Private CA also creates another S3 bucket that provides the ability to generate audit reports.

Securing internal services is a common use case for ACM Private CA. For example, a private certificate is useful to secure connections to your load balancers, API endpoints, applications, andinternal Wi-Fi. This service is also an infrastructure component of ACM, which has a wide variety of uses of its own. Examples include managing private certificates with the benefit of managed renewals and certificate binding, and issuing private certificates to identify AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) messages, or IoT devices. ACM Private CA also works well for customers who want areplacement for self-signed certificates and automation through APIs.
