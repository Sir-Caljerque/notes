Amazon Macie is a security service that uses machine learning to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS. Macie recognizes personally identifiable information (PII) such as passport numbers, medical ID numbers, and tax ID numbers. Macie also recognizes financial information, encryption keys, and credentials. Macie also provides you the ability to add custom-defined data types using regular expressions to enable Macie to discover proprietary or unique sensitive data for your business.

Currently, Macie protects data stored in Amazon S3 only and is available in most AWS Regions. Macie has dashboards and alerts that give visibility into data access by analyzing Amazon S3 resource-based policies and ACLs during sensitive data recovery. The service continuously monitors data and generates detailed alerts when it detects risk of unauthorized access or inadvertent data leaks.

With Macie, you have full control of the service through the Macie API set, and you can centrally manage Macie for multiple accounts. Macie integrates with AWS Organizations, which means that you can manage as many as 5,000 Macie accounts for a single AWS organization. You can also continue to use native Macie features for managing multiple accounts, which enables you to manage as many as 1,000 member accounts with a single Macie administrator account.
