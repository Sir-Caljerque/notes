A contentdelivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed system of caching servers. A CDN caches copies of commonly requested files (static content, such as Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML; Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS; JavaScript; and image files) that are hosted on the application origin server. The CDN delivers a local copy of the requested content from a cache edge or Point of Presence that provides the fastest delivery to the requester. 

CDNs also deliver dynamic content that is unique to the requester and is not cacheable. Having a CDN deliver dynamic content improves application performance and scaling. The CDN establishes and maintains secure connections closer to the requester. If the CDN is on the same network as the origin, routing back to the origin to retrieve dynamic content is accelerated. In addition, content such as form data, images, and text can be ingested and sent back to the origin, thus taking advantage of the low-latency connections and proxy behavior of the PoP.
