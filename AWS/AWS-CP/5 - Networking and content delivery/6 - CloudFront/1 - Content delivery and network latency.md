As explained earlier in this module when you were learning about AWS Direct Connect, one of the challenges of network communication is network performance. When you browse a website or stream a video, your request is routed through many different networks to reach an originserver. The originserver (or origin) stores the original, definitive versions of the objects (webpages, images, and media files). The number of network hops and the distance that the request must travel significantly affect the performance and responsiveness of the website. Further, network latency is different in various geographic locations. For these reasons, a content delivery network might be the solution.
