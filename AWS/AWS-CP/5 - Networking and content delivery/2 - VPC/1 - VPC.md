- Enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define
- Gives you control over your virtual networking resources, including:
    - Selection of IP address range
    - Creation of subnets
    - Configuration of route tables and network gateways
- Enables you to customize the network configuration for your VPC
- Enables you to use multiple layers of security

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a service that lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud (called a virtual private cloud, or VPC) where you can launch your AWS resources.

Amazon VPC gives you control over your virtual networking resources, including the selection of your own IP address range, the creation of subnets, and the configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure access to resources and applications.

You can also customize the network configuration for your VPC. For example, you can create a public subnet for your web servers that can access the public internet. You can place your backend systems (such as databases or application servers) in a private subnet with no public internet access.

Finally, you can use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists (network ACLs), to help control access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in each subnet.
