Amazon VPC enables you to provision virtual private clouds (VPCs). A VPCis a virtual network that is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. A VPC is dedicated to your account. VPCs belong to a single AWS Region and can span multiple Availability Zones.

After you create a VPC, you can divide it into one or more subnets. A subnetis a range of IP addresses in a VPC. Subnets belong to a single Availability Zone. You can create subnets in different Availability Zones for high availability. Subnets are generally classified as public or private. Public subnets have direct access to the internet, but private subnets do not.
