You can configure your VPCs in several ways, and take advantage of numerous connectivity options and gateways. These options and gateways include AWS Direct Connect (via DX gateways), NAT gateways, internet gateways, VPC peering, etc. It is not uncommon to find AWS customers with hundreds of VPCs distributed across AWS accounts and Regions to serve multiple lines of business, teams, projects, and so forth. Things get more complex when customers start to set up connectivity between their VPCs. All the connectivity options are strictly point-to-point, so the number of VPC-to-VPC connections can grow quickly. As you grow the number of workloads that run on AWS, you must be able to scale your networks across multiple accounts and VPCs to keep up with the growth.

Though you can use VPC peering to connect pairs of VPCs, managing point-to-point connectivity across many VPCs without the ability to centrally manage the connectivity policies can be operationally costly and difficult. For on-premises connectivity, you must attach your VPN to each individual VPC. This solution can be time-consuming to build and difficult to manage when the number of VPCs grows into the hundreds.

To solve this problem, you can use AWS Transit Gateway to simplify your networking model. With AWS Transit Gateway, you only need to create and manage a single connection from the central gateway into each VPC, on-premises data center, or remote office across your network. A transit gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks, which act like spokes. This hub-and-spoke model significantly simplifies management and reduces operational costs because each network only needs to connect to the transit gateway and not to every other network. Any new VPC is connected to the transit gateway, and is then automatically available to every other network that is connected to the transit gateway. This ease of connectivity makes it easier to scale your network as you grow.
