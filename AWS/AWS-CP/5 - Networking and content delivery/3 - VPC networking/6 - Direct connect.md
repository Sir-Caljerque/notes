One of the challenges of network communication is network performance. Performance can be negatively affected if your data center is located far away from your AWS Region. For such situations, AWS offers AWS Direct Connect, or DX. *AWS Direct Connect* enables you to establish a dedicated, private network connection between your network and one of the DX locations. This private connection can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections. DX uses openstandard 802.1q virtual local area networks (VLANs).

For more information about DX, see the AWS Direct Connect product page at https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/.
