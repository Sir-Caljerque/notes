The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model that is usedto explain how data travels over a network. It consists of seven layers and shows the common protocols and addresses that are used to send data at each layer. For example, hubs and switches work at layer 2 (the data link layer). Routers work at layer 3 (the network layer). The OSI model can also be used to understand how communication takes place in a virtual private cloud (VPC), which you will learn about in the next section.
