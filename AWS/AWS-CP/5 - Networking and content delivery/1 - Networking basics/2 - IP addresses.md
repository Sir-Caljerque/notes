Each client machine in a network has a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address that identifies it. An IP address is a numerical label in decimal format. Machines convert that decimal number to a binary format.

In this example, the IP address is 192.0.2.0. Each of the four dot (.)-separated numbers of the IP address represents 8 bits in octal number format. That means each of the four numbers can be anything from 0 to 255. The combined total of the four numbers for an IP address is 32 bits in binary format.
