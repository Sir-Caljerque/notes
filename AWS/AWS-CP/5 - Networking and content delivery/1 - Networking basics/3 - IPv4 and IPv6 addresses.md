IPv4 (32-bit) address: 192.0.2.0
IPv6 (128-bit) address: 2600:1f18:22ba:8c00:ba86:a05e:a5ba:00FF

A 32-bit IP address is called an IPv4 address. 

IPv6 addresses, which are 128 bits, are also available. IPv6 addresses can accommodate more user devices.

An IPv6 address is composed of eight groups of four letters and numbers that are separated by colons (:). In this example, the IPv6 address is 2600:1f18:22ba:8c00:ba86:a05e:a5ba:00FF. Each of the eight colon-separated groups of the IPv6 address represents 16 bits in hexadecimal number format. That means each of the eight groups can be anything from 0 to FFFF. The combined total of the eight groups for an IPv6 address is 128 bits in binary format.
