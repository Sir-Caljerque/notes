As you learned so far in this module, cloud computing offers many advantages over the traditional model. However, for most organizations, cloud adoption does not happen instantly. Technology is one thing, but an organization also consists of people and processes, and these three elements must all be in alignment for successful cloud adoption. Cloud computing introduces a significant shift in how technology is obtained, used, and managed. It also shifts how organizations budget and pay for technology services. Cloud adoption requires that fundamental changes are discussed and considered across an entire organization. It also requires that stakeholders across all organizational units—both within and outside IT—support these new changes. In this last section, you learn about the AWS CAF, which was created to help organizations design and travel an accelerated path to successful cloud adoption.
