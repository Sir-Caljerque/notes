Each organization’s cloud adoption journey is unique. However, in order for any organization to successfully migrate its IT portfolio to the cloud, three elements (that is, people, process, and technology) must be in alignment. Business and technology leaders in an organization must understand the organization’s current state, target state, and the transition that is needed to achieve the target state so they can set goals and create processes for staff.

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) provides guidance and best practices to help organizations identify gaps in skills and processes. It also helps organizations build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing—both across the organization and throughout the IT lifecycle—to accelerate successful cloud adoption. 

At the highest level, the AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called perspectives. Perspectives span people, processes, and technology. Each perspective consists of a set of capabilities, which covers distinct responsibilities that are owned or managed by functionally related stakeholders.

Capabilities within each perspective are used to identify which areas of an organization require attention. By identifying gaps, prescriptive work streams can be created that support a successful cloud journey.
