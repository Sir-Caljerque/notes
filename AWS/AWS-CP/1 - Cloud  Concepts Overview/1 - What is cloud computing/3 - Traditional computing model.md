- Infrastructure as hardware
    - In the traditional computing model, infrastructure is thought of as hardware. Hardware solutions are physical, which means they require space, staff, physical security, planning, and capital expenditure. 
- Hardware solutions:
    - Require space, staff, physical security, planning, capital, expenditure
    - Have long hardware procurement cycle
    - Require you to provision capacity by guessing theoretical maximum peaks

In addition to significant upfront investment, another prohibitive aspect of traditional computing is the long hardware procurement cycle that involves acquiring, provisioning, and maintaining on-premises infrastructure.

With a hardware solution, you must ask if there is enough resource capacity or sufficient storage to meet your needs, and you provision capacity by guessing theoretical maximum peaks. If you don’t meet your projected maximum peak, then you pay for expensive resources that stay idle. If you exceed your projected maximum peak, then you don’t have sufficient capacity to meet your needs. And if your needs change, then you must spend the time, effort, and money required to implement a new solution.

For example, if you wanted to provision a new website, you would need to buy the hardware, rack and stack it, put it in a data center, and then manage it or have someone else manage it. This approach is expensive and time-consuming.
