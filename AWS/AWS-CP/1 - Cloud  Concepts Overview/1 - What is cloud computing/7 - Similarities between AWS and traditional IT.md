There are many similarities between AWS and the traditional, on-premises IT space:
- AWS security groups, network access control lists (network ACLs), and AWS Identity and access management (IAM) are similar to firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), and administrators
- Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), are similar to routers, network pipelines, and switches.
- Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances are similar to on-premises servers
- Amazon Elastic Block Store, (EBS), Elastic File Systems (EFS), Simple Storage Service, (S3), and Relational Database Service (RDS) are similar to direct attatched storage (DAS), storage area networks (SAN), network attatched storage (NAS), and a relational database management service (RDBMS)

With AWS services and features, you can do almost everything that you would want to do with a traditional data center.
