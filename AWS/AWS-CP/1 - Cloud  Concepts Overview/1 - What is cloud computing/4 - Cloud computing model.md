- Infrastructure as a software
- Software solutions:
    - Are flexible
    - Can change more quickly, easily, and cost effectively than hardware solutions
    - Eliminate the undifferintiated heavy-lifting tasks

By contrast, cloud computing enables you to think of your infrastructure as software. Software solutions are flexible. You can select the cloud services that best match your needs, provision and terminate those resources on-demand, and pay for what you use. You can elastically scale resources up and down in an automated fashion. With the cloud computing model, you can treat resources as temporary and disposable. The flexibility that cloud computing offers enables businesses to implement new solutions quickly and with low upfront costs. 

Compared to hardware solutions, software solutions can change much more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively.

Cloud computing helps developers and IT departments avoid undifferentiated work like procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning, thus enabling them to focus on what matters most.

As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different service models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet the specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud service model and deployment strategy provides you with a different level of control, flexibility, and management. Understanding the differences between these cloud service models and deployment strategies can help you decide what set of services is right for your needs.
