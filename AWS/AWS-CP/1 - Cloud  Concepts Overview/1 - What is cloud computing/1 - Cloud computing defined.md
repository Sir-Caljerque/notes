**Cloud computing** is the **on-demand** delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources **via the internet** with **pay-as-you-go** pricing.
- These resources run on server computers that are located in large data centers in different locations around the world. When you use a cloud service provider like AWS, that service provider owns the computers that you are using. These resources can be used together like building blocks to build solutions that help meet business goals and satisfy technology requirements
