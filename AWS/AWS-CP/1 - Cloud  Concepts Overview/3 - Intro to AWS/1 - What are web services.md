In general, a web service is any piece of software that makes itself **available over the internet or on private (intranet) networks.** A web service uses a **standardized format**-such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)—for the request and the response of an application programming interface (API) interaction. It is not tied to any one operating system or programming language. It’s self-describing via an interface definition file and it is **discoverable**.
