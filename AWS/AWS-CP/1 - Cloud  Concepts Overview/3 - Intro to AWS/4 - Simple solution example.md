For example, say you’re building a database application. Your customers might be sending data to your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, which is a service in the compute category. These EC2 servers batch the data in one-minute increments and add an object per customer to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), the AWS storage service you’ve chosen to use. You can then use a nonrelational database like Amazon DynamoDB to power your application, for example, to build an index so that you can find all the objects for a given customer that were collected over a certain period. You might decide to run these services inside an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), which is a service in the networking category.

The purpose of this simple example is to illustrate that you can select web services from different categories and use them together to build a solution (in this case, a database application). Of course, the solutions you build can be quite complex.
