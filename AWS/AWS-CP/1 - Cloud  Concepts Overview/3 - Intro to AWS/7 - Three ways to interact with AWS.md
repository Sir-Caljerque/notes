You might wonder how to access the broad array of services that are offered by AWS. There are three ways to create and manage resources on the AWS Cloud:
- AWS Management Console: The console provides a rich graphical interface to a majority of the features offered by AWS. (Note: From time to time, new features might not have all of their capabilities included in the console when the feature initially launches.)
- AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI): The AWS CLI provides a suite of utilities that **can be launched from a command script in Linux, macOS, or Microsoft Windows**.
- Software development kits (SDKs): AWS provides packages that **enable accessing AWS in a variety of popular programming languages**. This makes it easy to use AWS in your existing applications and it also enables you to create applications that deploy and monitor complex systems entirely through code. 

All three options are built on a common REST-like API that serves as the foundation of AWS.
