**Running servers on-premises** is an expensive undertaking. Hardware must be procured, and this procurement can be based on project plans instead of the reality of how the servers are used. Data centers are expensive to build, staff, and maintain. Organizations also need to permanently provision a sufficient amount of hardware to handle traffic spikes and peak workloads. After traditional on-premises deployments are built, server capacity might be unused and idle for a significant portion of the time that the servers are running, which is wasteful. 

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides virtual machines where you can host the same kinds of applications that you might run on a traditional on-premises server. It provides secure, re-sizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 instances can support a variety of workloads. Common uses for EC2 instances include, but are not limited to:
- Application servers
- Web servers
- Database servers
- Game servers
- Mail servers
- Media servers
- Catalog servers
- File servers
- Computing servers
- Proxy servers

# EC2 overview
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)  
    - Provides *virtual machines*—referred to as *EC2 instances*—in the cloud.
    - Gives you full control over the guest operating system (Windows or Linux) on each instance.
- You can launch instances of any size into an Availability Zone anywhere in the world.
    - Launch instances from *Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)*.
    - Launch instances with a few clicks or a line of code, and they are ready in minutes.
- You can control traffic to and from instances.

The **EC2** in Amazon EC2 stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud:**
- Elastic refers to the fact that you can easily increase or decrease the number of servers you run to support an application automatically, and you can also increase or decrease the size of existing servers.
- Compute refers to reason why most users run servers in the first place, which is to host running applications or process data—actions that require compute resources, including processing power (CPU) and memory (RAM). 
- Cloud refers to the fact that the EC2 instances that you run are hosted in the cloud. 

Amazon EC2 provides virtual machines in the cloud and gives you full administrative control over the Windows or Linux operating system that runs on the instance. Most server operating systems are supported, including: Windows 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2019, Red Hat, SuSE, Ubuntu, and Amazon Linux.

An operating system that runs on a virtual machine is often called a guest operating system to distinguish it from the host operating system. The host operating system is directly installed on any server hardware that hosts one or more virtual machines.

With Amazon EC2, you can launch any number of instances of any size into any Availability Zone anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. Instances launch from **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**, which are effectively virtual machine templates. AMIs are discussed in more detail later in this module.

You can control traffic to and from instances by using security groups. Also, because the servers run in the AWS Cloud, you can build solutions that take use multiple AWS services.

# EC2 instance lifecycle

Here, you see the lifecycle of an instance. The arrows show **actions**that you can take and the boxes show the **state**the instance will enter after that action. An instance can be in one of the following states:
- **Pending**–When an instance is first launched from an AMI, or when you start a stopped instance, it enters the pending state when the instance is booted and deployed to a host computer. The instance type that you specified at launch determines the hardware of the host computer for your instance.
- **Running**–When the instance is fully booted and ready, it exits the pending state and enters the running state. You can connect over the internet to your running instance. 
- Rebooting –AWS recommends you reboot an instance by using the Amazon EC2 console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs instead of invoking a reboot from within the guest operating system (OS). A rebooted instance stays on the same physical host, maintains the same public DNS name and public IP address, and if it has instance store volumes, it retains the data on those volumes.
- **Shutting down** –This state is an intermediary state between running and terminated. 
- **Terminated**–A terminated instance remains visible in the Amazon EC2 console for a while before the virtual machine is deleted. However, you can’t connect to or recover a terminated instance. 
- **Stopping**–Instances that are backed by Amazon EBS can be stopped. They enter the stopping state before they attain the fully stopped state.
- **Stopped**–A stopped instance will not incur the same cost as a running instance. Starting a stopped instance puts it back into the pending state, which moves the instance to a new host machine

# Consider using and Elastic IP address

- **Rebooting** an instance will *not* change any IP addresses or DNS hostnames
- When an instance is *stopped*and then *started*again –
- The *public*IPv4 address and *external*DNS hostname will change.
- The *private*IPv4 address and internal DNS hostname do *not*change.
- If you require a persistent public IP address –
- Associate an Elastic IP address with the instance.
- Elastic IP address characteristics –
- Can be associated with instances in the Region as needed.
- Remains allocated to your account until you choose to release it.

A public IP addressis an IPv4 address that is reachable from the internet. Each instance that receives a public IP address is also given an external DNS hostname. For example, if the public IP address assigned to the instance is 203.0.113.25, then the external DNS hostname might beec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com.

If you specify that a public IP address should be assigned to your instance, it is assigned from the AWS pool of public IPv4 addresses. The public IP address is not associated with your AWS account. When a public IP address is disassociated from your instance, it is released back into the public IPv4 address pool, and you will not be able to specify that you want to reuse it. AWS releases your instance's public IP address when the instance is stopped or terminated. Your stopped instance receives a new public IP address when it is restarted.

If you require a persistent public IP address, you might want to associate an **Elastic IP address** with the instance. To associate an Elastic IP address, you must first allocate a new Elastic IP address in the Region where the instance exists. After the Elastic IP address is allocated, you can associate the Elastic IP address with an EC2 instance. 

By default, all AWS accounts are limited to five (5) Elastic IP addresses per Region because public (IPv4) internet addresses are a scarce public resource. However, this is a soft limit, and you can request a limit increase (which might be approved).

# EC2 instance data

- **Instance metadata**is data about your instance.
- While you are connected to the instance, you can view it –
    - In a browser: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
    - In a terminal window: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
- Example retrievable values –
    - Public IP address, private IP address, public hostname, instance ID, security groups, Region, Availability Zone.
    - Any user data specified at instance launch can also be accessed at: http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/
- It can be used to configure or manage a running instance.
    - For example, author a configuration script that reads the metadata and uses it to configure applications or OS settings.

Instance metadata is data about your instance. You can view it while you are connected to the instance. To access it in a browser, go to thefollowing URL: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/. The data can also be read programmatically, such as from a terminal window thathas the cURL utility.In the terminal window,run **curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta**-data/to retrieve it. The IP address *169.254.169.254*is a link-local address and it is valid only from the instance. 

Instance metadata provides much of the same information about the running instance that you can find in the AWS Management Console. For example, you can discover the public IP address, private IP address, public hostname, instance ID, security groups, Region, Availability Zone, and more. 

Any user data that is specified at instance launch can also be accessed at the following URL: http://169.254.169.254/latest/*user-data*.

EC2 instance metadata can be used to configure or manage a running instance. For example,you can author a configuration script that accesses the metadata information and uses it to configure applications or OS settings.

# Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring

- Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor EC2 instances2
- Provides near-real-time metrics
- Provides charts in the Amazon EC2 console Monitoringtab that you can view
- Maintains 15 months of historical data
- **Basic monitoring**
- Default, no additional cost
- Metric data sent to CloudWatch every 5 minutes
- **Detailed monitoring**
- Fixed monthly rate for seven pre-selected metrics 
- Metric data delivered every 1 minute

You can monitor your instances by using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from Amazon EC2 into readable, near-real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for a period of 15 months, so you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing.

By default, Amazon EC2provides **basic monitoring**,which sends metric data to CloudWatch in 5-minute periods. To send metric data for your instance to CloudWatch in 1-minute periods, you can enable**detailed monitoring**on the instance. For more information, seeEnable or Disable Detailed Monitoring for Your Instances at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-new.html.

The Amazon EC2 console displays a series of graphs based on the raw data from Amazon CloudWatch. Depending on your needs, you might prefer to get data for your instances from Amazon CloudWatch instead of through the graphs in the console. By default, Amazon CloudWatch does not provide RAM metrics for EC2 instances, though that is an option that you can configure if you want to CloudWatch to collect that data.

# Key takeaways

Some key takeaways from this section of the module include:
- Amazon EC2 enables you to run Windows and Linux virtual machines in the cloud.
- You launch EC2 instances from an AMI template into a VPC in your account.
- You can choose from many instance types. Each instance type offers different combinations of CPU, RAM, storage, and networking capabilities.
- You can configure security groups to control access to instances (specify allowed ports and source).
- User data enables you to specify a script to run the first time that an instance launches. 
- Only instances that are backed by Amazon EBS can be stopped. 
- You can use Amazon CloudWatch to capture and review metrics on EC2 instances.
