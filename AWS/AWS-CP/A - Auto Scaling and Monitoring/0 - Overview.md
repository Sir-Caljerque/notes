# Overview

This module will address the following topics:
- Elastic Load Balancing
- Amazon CloudWatch
- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

The module also includes two activities. One activity will challenge you to indicate Elastic Load Balancing use cases. The other activity will challenge you to identify Amazon CloudWatch examples.

The module also includes a hands-on lab where you will use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon CloudWatch together to create a dynamically scalable architecture.

# Objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:
- Indicate how to distribute traffic across Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances by using Elastic Load Balancing
- Identify how Amazon CloudWatch enables you to monitor AWS resources and applications in real time
- Explain how Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches and releases servers in response to workload changes
