AWS Organizations can be managed through different interfaces.

The **AWS Management Console** is a browser-based interface that you can use to manage your organization and your AWS resources. You can perform any task in your organization by using the console.

**AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) tools**enable you to issue commands at your system's command line to perform AWS Organizations tasks and AWS tasks. This method can be faster and more convenient than using the console.

You can use also **AWS software development kits (SDKs)** to handletasks such as cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically.AWS SDKs consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms,such as Java, Python, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android.

The **AWS Organizations HTTPS Query API** gives you programmatic access to AWS Organizations and AWS. You can use the API to issue HTTPS requests directly to the service. When you use the HTTPS API, you must include code to digitally sign requests by using your credentials.
