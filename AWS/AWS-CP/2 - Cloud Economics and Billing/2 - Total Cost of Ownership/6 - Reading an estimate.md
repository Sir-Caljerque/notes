- Your total upfront –How much you are estimated to pay upfront as you set up your AWS stack.
- Your total monthly –How much you're estimated to spend every month while you run your - AWS stack.

Within a group, you can see how much each service is estimated to cost. If you want to price out different ways to build your AWS setup, you can use different groups for each variation of your setup and compare the estimates for the different setups.
