You could save up to 96 percent a year by moving your infrastructure to AWS.
Your 3-year total savings would be $159,913

Here is a sample cost comparison. This example shows a cost comparison for an on-premises solution and a cloud solution over 3 years. For this comparison, two similar environments were constructed to represent the on-premises and AWS environments. Additional direct and indirect costs that are associated with the on-premises solution were not included. The components of the on-premises solution include:

- 1 virtual machine with 4 CPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and a Linux operating system
- Average utilization is 100 percent
- Optimized by RAM

The components of a comparable AWS environment include:
- 1 m4.xlarge instance with 4 CPUs, 16 GB of RAM
- The instance type is a 3-year Partial Upfront Reserved Instance

The on-premises 3-year total cost is $167,422. The AWS Cloud 3-year total cost is $7,509, which is a 96 percent savings over the on-premises solution. Thus, the 3-year total savings on cloud infrastructure would be $159,913. This comparison helps a business clearly understand the differences between the alternatives.

**What is the difference in costs?** 
Remember, the on-premises solution is predicted. It continues to incur costs whether the capacity is used.

In contrast, the AWS solution is commissioned when needed and decommissioned when the resources are no longer in use, which results in lower overall costs.
