Some of the costs that are associated with data center management include: 
- Servercosts for both hardware and software, and facilities costs to house the equipment. 
- Storagecosts for the hardware, administration, and facilities. 
- Networkcosts for hardware, administration, and facilities. 
- And IT labor costs that are required to administer the entire solution.

When you compare an on-premises to cloud solution, it is important to accurately assess the true costs of both options. With the cloud, most costs are upfront and readily calculated. For example, cloud providers give transparent pricing based on different usage metrics, such as RAM, storage, and bandwidth, among others. Pricing is frequently fixed per unit of time.

Customers gain certainty over pricing and are then able to readily calculate costs based on several different usage estimates.

Compare this process to on-premises technology. Though they are sometimes difficult to determine, calculations of in-house costs must take into account all:
- Direct costs that accompany running a serverâ€”like power, floor space, storage, and IT operations to manage those resources.
- Indirect costs of running a server, like network and storage infrastructure.

This diagram is conceptual, and it does not include every cost item. For example, depending on the solution you are implementing, software costs can include database, management, and middle-tier costs. Facilities costs can include upgrades, maintenance, building security, taxes, and so on. IT labor costs can include security administration and application administration costs.  This diagramincludes an abbreviated list to demonstrate the type of costs that are involved in data center maintenance.
