Hard benefits include reduced spending on compute, storage, networking, and security. They also 
include reductions in hardware and software purchases; reductions in operational costs, backup, 
and disaster recovery; and a reduction in operations personnel.

Cloud Total Cost of Ownership defines what will be spent on the technology after adoptionâ€”or what it costs to run the solution. Typically, a TCO analysis looks at the as-is on-premises infrastructure and compares it with the cost of the to-be infrastructure state in the cloud. While this difference might be easy to calculate, it might only provide a narrow view of the total financial impact of moving to the cloud.

A return on investment (ROI) analysis can be used to determine the value that is generated while considering spending and saving. This analysis starts by identifying the hard benefits in terms of direct and visible cost reductions and efficiency improvements.

Next, soft savings are identified. Soft savings are value points that are challenging to accurately quantify, but they can be more valuable than the hard savings. It is important for you to understand both hard and soft benefits to understand the full value of the cloud. Soft benefits include:
- Reusing service and applications that enable you to define (and redefine solutions) by using the same cloud service
- Increased developer productivity
- Improved customer satisfaction 
- Agile business processes that can quickly respond to new and emerging opportunities
- Increased global reach
Now, you will review a case study from Delaware North to see an actual TCO example.
