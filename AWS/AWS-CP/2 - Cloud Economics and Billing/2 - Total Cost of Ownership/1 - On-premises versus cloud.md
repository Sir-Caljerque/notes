On-premises versus cloud is a question that many businesses ask. The difference between these two options is how they are deployed.

An on-premises infrastructure is installed locally on a companyâ€™s own computers and servers. There are several fixed costs, also known as capital expenses, that are associated with the traditional infrastructure. Capital expenses include facilities, hardware, licenses, and maintenance staff. Scaling up can be expensive and time-consuming. Scaling down does not reduce fixed costs.

A cloud infrastructure is purchased from a service provider who builds and maintains the facilities, hardware, and maintenance staff. A customer pays for what is used. Scaling up or down is simple. Costs are easy to estimate because they depend on service use.

It is difficult to compare an on-premises IT delivery model with the AWS Cloud. The two are different because they use different concepts and terms. 

Using on-premises IT involves a discussion that is based on capital expenditure, long planning cycles, and multiple components to buy, build, manage, and refresh resources over time.Using the AWS Cloud involves a discussion about flexibility, agility, and consumption-based costs.

So, how can you identify the best option?
