Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is the financial estimate to help identify direct and indirect costs of a system.

Why use TCO?
- To compare the costs of running an entire infrastructure environment or specific workloadon-premises versus on AWS
- To budget and build the business case for moving to the cloud

You can identify the best option by comparing the on-premises solution to a cloud solution. Total Cost of Ownership (or TCO) is a financial estimate that is intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and indirect costs of a product or system. TCO includes the cost of a service, plus all the costs that are associated with owning the service.

You might want to compare the costs of running an entire infrastructure environment for a specific workload in an on-premises or collocation facility to the same workload running on a cloud-based infrastructure. This comparison is done for budgeting purposes or to build a business case for business decisions about the optimal deployment solution.
