It addition to understanding the costs that are associated with different support plans, it is critical that you understand the service levels that are associated with each plan. In addition to the support plan you select, the case severity will drive the type of response that you receive. There are five different severitylevels:
- **Critical** – Your business is at risk. Critical functions of your application are unavailable.
- **Urgent** – Your business is significantly impacted. Important functions of your application are unavailable.
- **High** – Important functions of your application are impaired or degraded.
- **Normal** – Non-critical functions of your application are behaving abnormally, or you have a time-sensitive development question.
- **Low** – You have a general development question, or you want to request a feature.

Note that there is no case support with the Basic Support Plan. These response times should be considered when you determine which support plan is best for your organization.
