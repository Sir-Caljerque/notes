For certain services like AmazonElastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), you can invest in reserved capacity. With Reserved Instances, you can save up to 75 percent over equivalent on-demand capacity. Reserved Instances are available in three options:
- All Upfront Reserved Instance (or AURI)
- Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (or PURI)
- No Upfront Payments Reserved Instance (or NURI)

When you buy Reserved Instances, youreceive a greater discount when you make alarger upfront payment. To maximize your savings, you can pay all upfront and receive the largest discount. Partial Upfront RIs offer lower discounts, but they give you the option to spend less upfront. Lastly, you can choose to spend nothing upfront and receive a smaller discount, which enables you to free capital to spend on other projects.

By using reserved capacity, your organization can minimize risks, more predictably manage budgets, and comply with policies that require longer-term commitments.
