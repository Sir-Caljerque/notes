AWS also offers a variety of services for no additional charge.
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)controls your users’ access to AWS services and resources.
- Consolidated Billing is a billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate payment for multiple AWS accounts or multiple Amazon Internet Services Private Limited (AISPL) accounts\*. Consolidated billing provides:
- One bill for multiple accounts.
- The ability to easily track each account’s charges.
- The opportunity to decrease charges as a result of volume pricing discounts from combined usage.
- And you can consolidate all of your accounts using Consolidated Billing and get tiered benefits.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an even easier way for you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud.
- AWS CloudFormationgives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create a collection of related AWS resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable fashion.
- Automatic Scalingautomatically adds or removes resources according to conditions you define. The resources you are using increase seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs.
- AWS OpsWorks is an application management service that makes it easy to deploy and 
operate applications of all shapes and sizes.

Though there is no charge for these services, there might be charges associated with other AWS services used with these services. For example, when you automatically scale additional EC2 instances, there will be charges for those instances.

> [!NOTE]
> The main difference between AWS accounts and AISPL accounts is the seller of record. AWS accounts are administered by Amazon Web Services, Inc., but AISPL accounts are administered by Amazon Internet Services Private Limited. If you used an Indian address when you created your account, your account's default seller of record is AISPL. By default, AISPL accounts are billed in Indian Rupees (INR). See more on the seller of record here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment-aispl.html#determine-seller.
