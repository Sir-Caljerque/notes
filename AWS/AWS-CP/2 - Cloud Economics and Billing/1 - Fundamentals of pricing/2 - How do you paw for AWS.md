This philosophy is what underlies AWS pricing. While the number and types of services offered by AWS have increased dramatically, our philosophy on pricing has not changed. At the end of each month, you pay for what you use. You can start or stop using a product at any time. No long-term contracts are required.
AWS offers a range of cloud computing services. For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually need. This utility-style pricing model includes:
- Pay for what you use
- Pay less when you reserve
- Pay less when you use more
- Pay even less as AWS grows 
You will now take a closer look at these core concepts of pricing.
