Unless you build data centers for a living, you might have spent too much time and money building them. With AWS, you pay only for the services that you consume with no large upfront expenses. You can lower variable costs, so you no longer need to dedicate valuable resources to building costly infrastructure, including purchasing servers, software licenses, or leasing facilities.
Quickly adapt to changing business needs and redirect your focus on innovation and invention by paying only for what you use and for as long as you need it. All AWS services are available on demand, require no long-term contracts, and have no complex licensing dependencies.
