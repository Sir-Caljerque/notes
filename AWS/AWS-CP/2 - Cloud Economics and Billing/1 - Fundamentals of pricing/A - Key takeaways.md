There is no charge (with some exceptions) for:
- Inbound data transfer.
- Data transfer between services within the same AWS Region.
- Pay for what you use.
- Start and stop anytime.
- No long-term contracts are required.
- Some services are free, but the other AWS services that they provision might not be free

In summary, while the number and types of services offered by AWS have increased dramatically, our philosophy on pricing has not changed. At the end of each month, you pay only for what you use, and you can start or stop using a product at any time. No long-term contracts are required. 

The best way to estimate costs is to examine the fundamental characteristics for each AWS service, estimate your usage for each characteristic, and then map that usage to the prices that are posted on the AWS website. The service pricing strategy gives you theflexibility to choose the services that you need for each project and to pay only for what you use.

There are several free AWS services, including: 
- Amazon VPC
- Elastic Beanstalk
- AWS CloudFormation
- IAM
- Automatic scaling services
- AWS OpsWorks
- Consolidated Billing 

While the services themselves are free, the resources that they provision might not be free. In most cases,there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS services within the same AWS Region. There are some exceptions,so be sure to verify data transfer rates before you begin to use the AWS service.Outbound data transfer costs are tiered.
