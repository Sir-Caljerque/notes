There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. These characteristics vary somewhat, depending on the AWS product and pricing model you choose.
In most cases,there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS services within the same AWS Region. There are some exceptions,so be sure to verify data transfer rates before you begin to use the AWS service.
Outbound data transfer is aggregated across servicesand then charged at the outbound data transfer rate. This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out
