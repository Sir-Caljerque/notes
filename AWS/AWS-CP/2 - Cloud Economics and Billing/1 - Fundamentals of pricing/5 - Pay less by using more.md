Realize volume-based discounts:
- **Savings** as usage increases
- **Tiered priving** for services like Amazon S3, EBS, or EFS -> the more you use, the less you pay per GB
- Multiple storage services deliver lower costs based on needs

With AWS, you can get volume-based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services like Amazon Simple StorageService (Amazon S3), pricing is tiered, which means that you pay less per GB when you use more. In addition, data transfer inis always free. Multiple storage services deliver lower storage costs based on your needs. As a result, as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economies of scale that enable you to increase adoption and keep costs under control.

As your organization evolves, AWS also gives you options to acquire services that help you address your business needs. For example, the AWS storage services portfolio offers options to help you lower pricing based on how frequently you access data and the performance that you need to retrieve it. To optimize your savings, you can choose the right combination of storage solutions that help you reduce costs while preserving performance, security, and durability.
