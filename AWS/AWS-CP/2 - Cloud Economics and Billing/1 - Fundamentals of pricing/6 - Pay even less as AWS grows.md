- AWS focuses on lowering the cost of doing business
- This practice results in AWS passing savings from economies of scale to you
- Since 2006, AWS hjas lowered pricing 75 times (as of September 2019)
- Future higher-performing resources replace current resources for no extra charge

AWS constantly focuses on reducing data center hardware costs, improving operational efficiencies, lowering power consumption, and generally lowering the cost of doing business.

These optimizations and the substantial and growing economies of scale of AWS result in passing savings back to you as lower pricing. Since 2006, AWS has lowered pricing 75times (as of September 2019).

Another benefit of AWS growth is that future, higher-performing resources replace current ones for no extra charge.
