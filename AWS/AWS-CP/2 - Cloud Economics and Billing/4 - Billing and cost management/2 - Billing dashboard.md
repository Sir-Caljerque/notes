The **AWS Billing Dashboard** lets you view the status of your month-to-date AWS expenditure, identify the services that account for the majority of your overall expenditure, and understand at a high level how costs are trending.

One of the graphs that is located on the dashboard is the Spend Summary.**The Spend Summary** shows you how much you spent last month, the estimated costs of your AWS usage for the month to date, and a forecast for how much you are likely to spend this month.

Another graph is **Month-to-Date Spend by Service**,which shows the top services that you use most and the proportion of costs thatare attributed to that service.

# Tools
From the billing dashboard, you can access several other cost management tools that you can use to estimate and plan your AWS costs.These tools include AWS Bills, AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and AWS Cost and Usage Reports.

# Monthly Bills
The **AWS Bills page** lists the costs that you incurred over the past month for each AWS service, with a further breakdown by AWS Region and linked account.

This tool gives you access to the most up-to-date information on your costs and usage, including your monthly bill and the detailed breakdown of the AWS services that you use.
