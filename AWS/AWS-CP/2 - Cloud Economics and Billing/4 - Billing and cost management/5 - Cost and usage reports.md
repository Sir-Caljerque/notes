The **AWS Cost and Usage Report** is a single location for accessing comprehensive information about your AWS costs and usage. This tool lists the usage for each service category that is used by an account (and its users) in hourly or daily line items,and any tax that you activated for tax allocation purposes.

You can choose to have AWS to publish billing reports to an S3 bucket. These reports can be updated once a day.
