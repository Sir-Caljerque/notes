what is TCO?
[read definition]

there are several considerations when deciding an on-premises vs cloud solution:
**Server**
costs for both hardware and software, and facilities costs to house the equipment. 
**Storage**
costs for the hardware, administration, and facilities. 
**Network**
costs for hardware, administration, and facilities. 
**IT labor**
costs that are required to administer the entire solution. 

you could save **96%** by moving infrastructure to AWS, as seen here

# 3
This is a simulated scenario where there is 100% util of 4-cores, 16GB RAM VM
remember, with AWS, you only pay for what you use, in an on-premise solution, the capacity incurs cost whether it is used or not

# case study
for example, a company called delaware north had trouble keeping up with replacing old equipment due to pricing.
They migrated 50 websites to AWS, as a test
test showed dramatically decreased costs
eliminated 205 servers
saved $3.5mil over 5 years
