- Elasticity and scalability
    - Elastic infrastructure; dynamic adaption of capacity
    - Scalable infrastructure; adapts to accommodate growth 
- Fault-tolerance
    - Continues operating properly in the presence of a failure
    - Built-in redundancy of components
- High availability
    - High level of operational performance
    - Minimized downtime
    - No human intervention

Now that you have a good understanding of the major components that comprise the AWS Global Infrastructure, let's consider the benefits provided by this infrastructure.

The AWS Global Infrastructure has several valuable features:
- First, it is **elastic**and **scalable.** This means resources can dynamically adjust to increases or decreases in capacity requirements. It can also rapidly adjust to accommodate growth.
- Second, this infrastructure is **fault tolerant,** which means it has built-in component redundancy which enables it to continue operations despite a failed component.
- Finally, it requires minimal to no human intervention, while providing **high availability** with minimal down time.
