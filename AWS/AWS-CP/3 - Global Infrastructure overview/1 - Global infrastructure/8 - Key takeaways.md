Some key takeaways from this section of the module include:
- The **AWS Global Infrastructure**consists of **Regions** and **Availability Zones**.
- Your choice of a **Region**is typically based on **compliance requirements** or to **reduce latency**.
- Each **Availability Zone** is physically separate from other Availability Zones and has redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- **Edge locations**, and **Regional****edge caches** improve performance by **caching**content closer to users.
