AWS database services include the services listed here, and many others.

**Amazon Aurora** is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database. It is up to five times faster than standard MySQLdatabases and three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases.

**Amazon Redshift** enables you to run analytic queries against petabytes of data that is stored locally in Amazon Redshift, and directly against exabytes of data that are stored in Amazon S3. It delivers fast performance at any scale.

**Amazon DynamoDB** is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale, with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching.
