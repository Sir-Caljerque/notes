As discussed previously, the AWS Global Infrastructure can be broken down into three elements: Regions, Availability Zones, and Points of Presence, which include edge locations. This infrastructure provides the platform for a broad set of services, such as networking, storage, compute services, and databasesâ€”and these services are delivered as an on-demand utility that is available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing.

The next level up is labeled Foundational Services and includes graphics for compute, networking, and storage. That level is highlighted. Next level up is platform services that includes databases, analytics, app services, deployment and management, and mobile services. Top layer is labeled applications and includes virtual desktops and collaboration and sharing.
