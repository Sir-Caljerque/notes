**AWS Artifact** provides on-demand downloads of AWS security and compliance documents, such as AWS ISO certifications, Payment Card Industry (PCI), and Service Organization Control (SOC) reports. You can submit the security and compliance documents (also known asaudit artifacts) to your auditors or regulators to demonstrate the security and compliance of the AWS infrastructure and services that you use. You can also use these documents as guidelines to evaluate your own cloud architecture and assess the effectiveness of your company's internal controls. AWS Artifact provides documents about AWS only. AWS customers are responsible for developing or obtaining documents that demonstrate the security and compliance of their companies.

You can also use AWS Artifact to review, accept, and track the status of AWS agreements such as the Business Associate Agreement (BAA). A BAA typically is required for companies that are subject to HIPAA to ensure that protected health information (PHI) is appropriately safeguarded. With AWS Artifact, you can accept agreements with AWS and designate AWS accounts that can legally process restricted information. You can accept an agreement on behalf of multiple accounts. To accept agreements for multiple accounts, use AWS Organizations to create an organization.
