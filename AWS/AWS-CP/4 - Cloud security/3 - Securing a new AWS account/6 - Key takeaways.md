The key takeaways from this section of the module are all related to best practices for securing an AWS account. Those best practice recommendations include:
- Secure logins with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Delete account root user access keys.
- Create individual IAM users and grant permissions according to the principle of least privilege.
- Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users.
- Configure a strong password policy.
- Delegate using roles instead of sharing credentials.
- Monitor account activity using AWS CloudTrail.
