While the cloud infrastructure is secured and maintained by AWS, customers are responsible for security of everything they put **in**the cloud. 

The **customer is responsible**for what is implemented by using AWS services and for the applications that are connected to AWS. The security stepsthatyou must take depend on the services that you use and the complexity of your system.

Customer responsibilities include selecting and securing any instance operating systems, securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources, security group configurations, firewall configurations, network configurations, and secure account management. 

When customers use AWS services, they maintain complete control over their content.Customers are responsible for managing critical content security requirements, including: 
- What content they choose to store on AWS
- Which AWS services are used with the content
- In what country that content is stored
- The format and structure of that content and whether it is masked, anonymized, or encrypted
- Who has access to that content and how those access rights are granted, managed, and revoked

Customers retain control of what security they choose to implement to protect their own data, environment, applications, IAM configurations, and operating systems.
