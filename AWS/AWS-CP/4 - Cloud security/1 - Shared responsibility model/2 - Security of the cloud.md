AWS is responsible for security *of*the cloud. But what does that mean?

Under the AWS shared responsibility model, AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the bare metal host operating system and hypervisor virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where the services operate. It means that AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. The global infrastructure includes AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations.

AWS is responsible for the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources, including:
- **Physical security of data centers** with controlled, need-based access; located in nondescript facilities, with 24/7 security guards;two-factor authentication; access logging and review; video surveillance; and disk degaussing and destruction.
- **Hardware infrastructure**,such as servers, storage devices, and other appliances that AWS relies on.
- **Software infrastructure**,which hosts operating systems, service applications, and virtualization software.
- **Network infrastructure**, such asrouters, switches, load balancers, firewalls, and cabling. AWS also continuously monitors the network at external boundaries, secures access points, and provides redundant infrastructure with intrusion detection.

Protecting this infrastructure is the top priority for AWS. While you cannot visit AWS data centers or offices to see this protection firsthand, Amazon provides several reports from third-party auditors who have verified our compliance with a variety of computer security standards and regulations.
