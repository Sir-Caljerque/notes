**AWS Shield** 
is a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards 
applications that run on AWS. It provides always
-
on detection and automatic inline mitigations 
that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to 
benefit from DDoS protection. 

AWS Shield helps protects your website from all types of DDoS attacks, including Infrastructure layer attacks (like User Datagram Protocol—or UDP—floods), state exhaustion attacks (like TCP SYN floods), and application-layer attacks (like HTTP GET or POST floods). For examples,see the AWS WAF Developer Guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html.

**AWS Shield Standard** is automatically enabled to all AWS customers at no additional cost.

**AWS Shield Advanced** is an optional paid service. AWS Shield Advanced provides additional protections against more sophisticated and larger attacks for your applications that run on Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53. AWS Shield Advanced is available to all customers. However, to contact the DDoS Response Team, customers need tohave either Enterprise Support or Business Support from AWS Support.
