Some keytakeaways from this section of the module include:
- **IAM policies** are constructed with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and define permissions.
    - IAM policies can be attached to any **IAM entity**.
    - Entities are IAM users, IAM groups, and IAM roles.
- An **IAM user** provides a way for a person, application, or service to authenticate to AWS.
- An **IAM group** is a simple way to attach the same policies to multiple users.
- An **IAM role** can have permissions policies attached to it,and can be used to delegate temporary access to users or applications.
