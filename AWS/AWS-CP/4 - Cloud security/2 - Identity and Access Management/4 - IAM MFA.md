- MFA provides increased security.
- In addition to **username** and **password**, MFA requires a unique **authentication code** to access AWS services.

AWS servicesand resources can be accessed by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or through SDKs and APIs. For increased security, we recommend enabling MFA. 

With MFA, users and systems must provide an **MFA token** — in addition to the regular sign-in credentials — before they can access AWS services and resources. 

Options for generating the MFA authentication token include **virtual MFA** - compliant applications (such as Google Authenticator or Authy 2-Factor Authentication), **U2F security key devices**, and **hardware MFA devices**.
